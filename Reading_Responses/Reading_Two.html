<h2>Poetry of tools 
Reading response </h2>
<p>
1.	What Mindy Seu is asking is to do is as users of digital tools is to pay attention to the user interface. To take a look at the pointer. Study its shape and how it changes. She wants us to study the way we interact with a text box. Or how the button element is shaped and how it clicks. She wants us to look beyond the function of the digital tools. Ultimately Seu is inviting us to look at our tools in a way we would a poem. Try to interpret the reasoning why a bloc of text is positioned on a page. Why specific colors appear on a page how a pointer interacts with an element on a page. We start to ask new questions like how and why these elements interact the way they do.</p>

<h3>2.	 SLOW DEATH</h3>
<p>I’ve never consciously thought about the Internet or web pages (to be specific) as alive. Or have I thought of the idea that web pages could die. But when thinking about this as an ability a site could have I started to think about a few things. I think we can give a site life and death and both can function at the same time and at different times for a web page. One way to look at this idea is that a web page gains life when it is published and accessed. So its life is operated by time and use or awareness.  It’s death in this case would be the absence of use or its decay or lack of improvement or update over time. When thinking about pages in this way I’m reminded of sites I used to visit in middle school as a young teen.</p>

<p>The urge to visit and see if the link to those sites is hard to induldge but by visiting a site one of two things will happen.</p>

 <p>If I visit the site and it is still accessible. There is the possibility that it has not been updated since the last time I or the last programmer/ user since accessed it. This creates a situation where it may not be able to operate on the current version (at the time of writing) of the web. In this situation you could describe the site as “dying”. Its ultimate death culminating in broken links and pages and failure to load.</p>

<p>The second situation is accessing the site invites the possibility that the site is very much actve and operating in a contemporary (for the internet) way. This could mean that plugins and features on my browser work flawlessly and images and links load without being broken. In the advent of this situation I would consider this page alive, BUT, the version I may remember from my formative years is now dead. SO this can be described as a page alive but my memory of it dying.</p>

<p>Two sites off the top of my head that I would consider would be able to explain this situation are.
<a href="www.Neopets.com">-	www.NeoPets.com</a>
<a href="www.NewGrounds.com">-	www.NewGrounds.com </a>
</p>
<p>No I will not venture into the nostalgic rabbit hole or have my memory ruined by what these two sites may now represent.</p>
