<p>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</p>
 
<p>Lialina’s opinion of the word user is that of an entity that if left to be classified by developers and merged into being synonymous with the word “people” it would slowly erase the dual classification of a single entity. Describing the user as invisible or disappearing removes the idea of there being a device that still has to be interacted with to complete an experience or task.</p>
 
<p>Being too concerned with dumbing down or making the system more convenient for the user, is an opportunity to lose the ability to be in control of their own experience on the internet. Ultimately maintain complete ambiguity while retaining the idea that the user is still interacting with an interface.</p>
 
<p>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</p>
 
<p>Lialina’s ideal internet user is the general purpose or Turing user. This user can follow the rules of the system to achieve the desired goal. But given enough time the general-purpose user “can achieve their goals regardless of the primary method of and application or device”</p>
 
<p>These users complete their desired tasks through a method of habit. They are autonomous, and need not follow one method to a single solution. They build their experiences in tandem with technology and the internet. They are aware of multiple applications of a single technology regardless of how incredible or inane it might be.</p>
 
<p>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</p>
 
<p>I think of areas where the user of a system or interface must help the system in completing a task. . From filling a form on a website, or buying something online, to making a post on a comment page. These tasks need a user input and categorization and cannot be completed by the system alone. But the user must adhere to the rules in that interface to complete their desired tasks.</p>
 
<p>Making a purchase on amazon, I would have to select a desired item. Then put it into my online shopping cart. Then input the correct payment information and delivery information. All to complete and confirm my shipment and purchase.</p>
